> Layui is an open-source and free web UI component library developed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to facilitate the efficient creation of modern web interfaces. Over the years, it has been widely adopted for its distinctive design style. Layui significantly lowers the barrier for non-front-end developers to build complex web pages, enabling them to implement required page elements and interactions directly within the browser environment without relying on build tools.

## Break with the old and establish the new 🌱

On October 14, 2016, Layui released its first version `1.0.0`, after which it was widely adopted across web platforms.

On October 13, 2021, Layui announced the decommissioning of its original official website (<a href="https://unpkg.com/outeres@0.0.7/img/layui/notice-2021.png" target="_blank">details</a>) and migrated its documentation site to Gitee Pages. Concurrently, community management and daily maintenance activities were fully transitioned to both Gitee and Github platforms, encouraging users to embrace other superior mainstream frameworks. This move inadvertently led some to believe that Layui had ceased updates. In reality, since then, Layui has remained active on Github and Gitee, never halting updates, progressing from version `2.6.8` at the time to its current latest release.

On April 24, 2023, Layui released version `2.8.0` officially and launched a [new documentation site](https://layui.dev). This marked a sincere comeback and a continuation of its commitment to open-source ideals. We still uphold the perspective expressed in the announcement two years ago, advocating that developers embrace mainstream technologies and nurture an unwavering passion for cutting-edge advancements. **What Layui does is to fill those narrow gaps outside the mainstream**. Although not a mainstream frontend framework, Layui has long transcended being a personal creation of its author, becoming a collective work of all who persist in using it. It continues to underpin numerous projects and represents the efforts of many individuals. As open-source creators, we should walk alongside these dedicated Layui developers.

On October 24, 2025, Layui released version `2.13.0` as the final major version of the 2.x series. This marked a tribute to the bittersweet decade past and officially ushered in a new chapter.

In the future, Layui will steadfastly accompany all those who hold it dear, jointly substantiating the feasibility of the Layui development model.
